Installation intructions:

Please download mtimesx 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25977-mtimesx-fast-matrix-multiply-with-multi-dimensional-support
, extract it into the 'thirdparty' folder, and compile. The compile command
    mex CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -std=c99" -DDEFINEUNIX -largeArrayDims -lmwblas mtimesx.c 
may solve some compile problems.

smanifold can be tested by starting MATLAB in the directory containing this
file and running 'surfacePGA'. If 'startup.m' is not executed automatically upon
MATLAB startup, please run it before 'surfacePGA' in order to setup paths.
